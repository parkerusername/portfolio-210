Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project I submitted was our final project, it was just a system to read in a text file and output data on occurences of items. Very simple, but touches
on a lot of important points. It's also done with C++ and Python integrated which has numerous business applications. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel that my code was rather well organized and easy to understand, as well as being tolerant to errors and unexpected behavior.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could make the code more user friendly, such as by including graphics or opening a window instead of doing everything through the console. That was far outside
the scope of the project though, so I left it out.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Integrating Python and C++ was quite the challenge for me, I don't use either language too often and it was new experience. That being said, now I feel far more comfortable
in both languages which is something.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Manipulating data is always a valuable skill. It's especially important if you're doing backend development, where you're also interacting with databases.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I commented where necesary, and stuck to best practice. I did my best to ensure that my code was straigtforward and scalable.
